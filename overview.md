### What is it?

Quantum computing is new type of computing - different than classical - that allows for computations to be performed quicker and with more granularity. It's limiting factor is the natural uncertainty at the atomic scale - which is the scale it operates on.

### How does it work?

### Expectations:

What comes next from quantum computing is as exciting as it is unpredictable. Overtime we have seen quantum computing develop from theoritcial to expiremental. Hopefully soon we will see more practical applications also known as quantum utility. As I try to estimate what is possible for quantum utility I explore the fundamental concepts of quantum computing, the underlying hardware, and recent implemntations of quantum computing.

### The Hardware:

each qubit must be able to:

1. be prepared in a superposition of states
2. be manipulated using quantum gates
3. be measured and collapsing to classical information

### Recent Implementations:

- QCWare improvement of random forest model using detrimental point processing (DPP).

### Companies:

- IBM
- QCWare
- D-Wave
- Rigetti
- Google
- Microsoft
- Intel
- Honeywell
