video: understanding noise in near-term quantum computers

quantum computers suffer from hardware noise.

categories of noise:

- State preparation and measurement errors (SPAM)
  - this is an imperfect acquisition of the qubit state
- incoherent noise (2 types)
  - energy relaxation - the process of losing energy to the environment 1 -> 0(T1)
  - dephasing
- coherent noise
